# ec-monitor: Error central montitoring

Typescript package that will montitor the log files generated by `ec-bash`
and attempt to detect any error messages that appear there.

When an error message is found:

1. The error is sent to the ec server
2. A callback function is called. When used with the `vscode-extension`, this
   callback is used to display error info in VS Code.

It can be run standalone, or included as a module in other projects. It is needed by the VSCode extension.

## Development

_We reccomend using the VS Code workspace `./ec.code-workspace` which allows you to work on all EC components simultaneously._
